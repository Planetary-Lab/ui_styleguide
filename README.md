# PlanetLab Styleguide

Hello and welcome to the UI Styleguide for PlanetLab! This repo/styleguide should serve as your code guide for all UI elements. If it's not in here, and it should be, feel free to add it! Otherwise, this repo will serve as the most up-to-date example of what all UI elements should look like.

## Setting Up

## Contributing

Please contribute! Any and all additions and updates are welcome. In order to contribute, please make a branch first, following the git-flow workflow (meaning, name your branch `feature/<your feature name here>`). Make all your changes on that branch. Then, please make a comment in Slack notifying others of your changes -- the reason for them, what you changed, etc. (This is mostly just a formality.) Then, once it's been approved by others, merge it into master. You have officially contributed!

## Visiting on the Web

The styleguide will eventually be put on the planetary-lab.org servers for easy access/reference. Once that's done, the url will be added here!
